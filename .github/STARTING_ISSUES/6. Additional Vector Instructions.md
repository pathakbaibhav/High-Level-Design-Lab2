In this issue we're going to add new functionality to a vector adder within the vector processor to promote it to a full fledged vector processor. 

## Expanding Functionality
- Use the contents of the CSR to distinguish between all of the operation available in the vector processor
- Note that a single write to the CSR will serve a dual purpose 1) It will define what type of operation should be performed and 2) and initiate the operation at the same time.
- The CSR will still be used to signal when an operation concludes by having it's value set to 0x0 at the end of the operation
- The full set of operations are listed in the [CSR opcode table](/README.md#vector-accelerator-opcodes).

## Validating the vector processor
- Extend the previously created vector_testbench.c from the last issue to includes tests for all of the new features
- Make sure to try out different initializations of the output vector when performing multiply and accumulate operations. Discuss any range limitations that the processor may have.
